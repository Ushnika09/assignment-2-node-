# 🚀 Running a Node.js Application

---

## 📦 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

---

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ushnika09/assignment-2-node-.git
   cd <repo-folder>
Install dependencies:

 ```bash
npm install
```
▶️ Running the Application
Start the app with:
```bash
Copy code
```
npm start
👉 This runs the app using nodemon, so the server will automatically restart when you make changes.
